# TDI_project_proposal
###  I am proposing a project to help the Austin police  department (APD), allocate their resources to certain areas by predicting the crimes depending on time of the day, the day and the month. I performed an exploratory study on the crime data based on zip_code, income and population for 2017. I generated a google heat map for the highest crime zones.

### Some of the interesting results is the abnormally high crime rates in the zip_code (78701) which is the downtown area. however, the profile of types of crimes change as alcohol and drugs related crimes are highest in the downtown area.
### The heat map shows that most of the highest crime areas are around the highway I-35.
